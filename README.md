## Purpose

This project is developed purely for fun and as a hobby.
The main purpose is to experiment and gain hands-on experience with various technologies. It serves as a playground for trying out new ideas and concepts without any particular end goal or specific audience in mind.

As this is a personal project, contributions are not expected. However, if you find something interesting or have suggestions, feel free to reach out.

# How to play

You will need a controller (any keyboard binding is just for debugging purpose).
